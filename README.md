# Python_projects
Welcome to my GitHub repository! This repository contains a collection of Python projects developed by me. Here's a brief overview of each project:

1. `calcgui.py`: This project is a simple calculator implemented using the Tkinter library. It provides a graphical user interface where you can perform basic arithmetic calculations.

2. `interactive_image.py`: In this project, I have created an interactive image application using Tkinter. You can drag and move an image within the window and also observe the current time displayed in a clock format.

3. `interactive_widgets.py`: This project showcases the usage of various interactive widgets available in Tkinter. It includes buttons, labels, and key bindings to perform actions like moving an object, changing text, and handling keypress events.

4. `snake_game.py`: The Snake Game is a classic game implemented in Python using the Tkinter library. You control a snake and navigate it to eat food while avoiding collisions with the boundaries and its own tail.

5. `tic_tac_toe.py`: This project allows you to play the popular Tic Tac Toe game with another player. It features a graphical user interface where you take turns and compete to get three of your symbols in a row.

Feel free to explore and use these projects as references or for your own learning purposes. Each project is self-contained and can be run independently. Enjoy!
